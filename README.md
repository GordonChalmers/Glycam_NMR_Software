Various software developed for calculating NMR observables from trajectories is located 
at the Glycam site.  Comparing predicted observables to experimental values can be used 
to interpret experimental results, improve molecular modeling and force field parameters, 
and also in improving experimental parameters.  

These packages at Glycam are: 

    3J_Coupling_Distribution 
    
        http://legacy.glycam.org/docs/othertoolsservice/download/Software/publication-software/3J_coupling_distribution.tar_.gz
  
    ASSIGN_SLP_Redirect - This is an older version of Assign_SLP_MD and to avoid multiple copies on 2 sites this links to the JHP 
        software site.  However, the ASSIGN_SLP_1_12 is a separate repository here.

    MD2NOE - This is an older version of MD2NOE_Protein, suitable for small molecules not proteins.

    particular_relaxation_rate
        This is a large file and please download from:
    
        http://legacy.glycam.org/docs/othertoolsservice/wp-content/uploads/sites/15/2017/04/particular_relaxation_rate.tar_.gz
  
    Single_Frame_NMR 
    
        http://legacy.glycam.org/docs/othertoolsservice/download/Software/publication-software/SingleFrameNMR.tar_.gz

All of these have been central to their respective publications, as with all molecular 
software that I have developed.  The primary paper(s) are given in the documentation folder 
of the download.  The downloads have the software, documentation, instructions, example usages, 
and the relevant paper(s).

Curl can be used to download the packages at the command line: 

        curl -# -o Paxkage Package_URL

In-house developed software relevant to Glycam is at: 

    http://legacy.glycam.org/docs/othertoolsservice/publication-related-materials/browse-publication-related-materials/index.html

There are several more unreleased completed or near completed Glycam related software packages.
