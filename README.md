Various software developed for calculating NMR observables from trajectories is located 
at the Glycam site.  Comparing predicted observables to experimental values can be used 
to interpret experimental results, improve molecular modeling and force field parameters, 
and also in improving experimental parameters.  

These packages at Glycam are: 

    3J_Coupling_Distribution 
  
    Assign_SLP
  
    MD2NOE
  
    particular_relaxation_rate
  
    Single_Frame_NMR 

All of these have been central to their respective publications, as with all molecular 
software that I have developed.  The downloads have the software, documentation, 
instructions, example usages, and the relevant paper(s).

There are several unreleased software packages written while working in the Woods group 
and Glycam, some of which are described in the Presentations repository.
