Various software developed for calculating NMR observables from trajectories is located 
at the Glycam site.  Comparing predicted observables to experimental values can be used 
to interpret experimental results, improve molecular modeling and force field parameters, 
and also in improving experimental parameters.  

These packages at Glycam are: 

    3J_Coupling_Distribution

    Assign_SLP_Redirect  (to avoid multiple copies on 2 sites this points to the JHP software site)
  
    MD2NOE - This is an older version of MD2NOE_Protein, suitable for small molecules not proteins, which is contained in this GitHub account.

    Single_Frame_NMR

All of these have been central to their respective publications, as with all molecular 
software that I have developed.  The downloads have the software, documentation, 
instructions, example usages, and the relevant paper(s).

There are several unreleased software packages written while working in the Woods group 
and Glycam, some of which are described in the GRC_Presentations repository.
